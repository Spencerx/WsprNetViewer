Now with great circle and heat map plotting on Google maps!
Something to try out:
  Tap 'Map' near the top of the screen.
  Long-click a location on the map to set your QTH.
  In the Maps settings, turn on TX markers.
  Zoom in on a marker to click it; the pop-up displays the beacon data.
  Touch the pop-up to display the directional antenna heading from your QTH to the beacon.
Note: Google maps with the large number of beacons is resource intensive.  Performance on older devices, Gingerbread/Android 2.3 and below, will be slower.
